# Real-Time Search with Highlighting

This project is a simple web application that allows users to perform real-time search on a list of items, highlighting the matching parts of the text as they type. The project is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- Real-time search: Filters the list of items as the user types in the search field.
- Highlighting: Highlights the matching parts of the text in each item.
- Debounced input: Efficient handling of input events to prevent performance issues with larger datasets.
- Scrollable list: Handles larger lists of items by making the list scrollable.
- No results message: Displays a message when no items match the search query.

## Files

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that contains the structure of the web page.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file that contains the styles for the web page.
- `scripts.js`: The JavaScript file that contains the logic for filtering and highlighting the list of items.
